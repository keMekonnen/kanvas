## what is this?

kanvas is a cross between a game and a game engine. It is meant to to be easy to modify and allow people to be free to use their imagination. its made to be accessible and easy to comprehend for the most begginer of game devs.

## How is it structured

the ```src``` folder is made up all the different components needed for a game, there will be docs in this folder going in depth into each. 
It all starts at the ```instance.js``` which contatins the game-specific details and game play loop. it imports a couple classes, the most important being the ```Kanvas``` class from ```annex.js```, it bring the most important components together to be used and accesed.

## plans for kanvas

The code does need to be cleaned, and frankly is a bit of mess. Optimaization will be necessary as the project keeps scaling.
MMO and networking components will be built out after physics game logic is integrated. All assets used will be free to use and in the public domain.
